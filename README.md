üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

Backend Setup

1. Environment variables
First, create the environment variables file .env in the server folder. The .env file contains the following environment variables:

MONGODB_URI = your MongoDB URL
JWT_SECRET = any secret key - must be secured
PORT = 8800 or any port number 
NODE_ENV = development
 

Set Up MongoDB:

Setting up MongoDB involves a few steps:

Visit MongoDB Atlas Website

Go to the MongoDB Atlas website: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas.
Create an Account

Log in to your MongoDB Atlas account.

Create a New Cluster

Choose a Cloud Provider and Region

Configure Cluster Settings

Create Cluster

Wait for Cluster to Deploy

Create Database User

Set Up IP Whitelist

Connect to Cluster

Configure Your Application

Test the Connection

Create a new database and configure the .env file with the MongoDB connection URL.

Steps to run frontend

Open the project in any editor of choice.

Navigate into the server directory cd backend.

Run npm i or npm install to install the packages.

üß† Approach & Architecture
Backend (Server)

Express.js: Handles HTTP requests and routes.

MongoDB & Mongoose: Manages data storage and schema definitions.

JWT Authentication: Secures API endpoints and manages user sessions.

CORS: Configured to allow cross-origin requests from the frontend.

Frontend (Client)
React.js: Builds the user interface with component-based architecture.

React Router: Manages navigation between different views.

Axios: Facilitates HTTP requests to the backend API.

lucide-react : Provides pre-designed components for a responsive UI.

Features
User authentication (register, login, logout)

CRUD operations for tasks

Task categorization (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Completed)

Responsive design for mobile and desktop views

‚ö†Ô∏è Assumptions & Trade-offs
Assumptions
Users have basic knowledge of using web applications.

The application is intended for personal or small team use.

MongoDB is used for data storage; no SQL database is involved.

Trade-offs
No Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): The app assumes all users have the same level of access, which may not be suitable for larger teams requiring different permission levels.

No Real-Time Updates: The application does not implement real-time features like WebSockets, so users need to refresh the page to see updates made by others.
